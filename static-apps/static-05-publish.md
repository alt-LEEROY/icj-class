# Make it pretty and publish

## Index updates

- On the index, adjust the first section of code with the H1 and intro text, replace it it with something creative you write that introduces this blog about a ship's travel.
- When viewed on a desktop, the display of the index is really wide and not very readable. Play with the column [grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/) on the index so that the content uses full width on mobile, but fewer columns at the `sm` and higher breakpoints. The content should be centered on the page, though, which you can do by applying an [offset](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/#offsetting-columns) to move the column over to the right.

## Detail page updates

- Add some content to all three detail pages so you can easily tell them apart when you view those pages. Like new headlines. The text can just be different lorem ipsum text. Add a different Kraken photo to each page, with an img-fluid class.
- Be sure to update the "page_title" and "page_description" blocks on each page to info relevant for that page.

## Publish and check

- Publish this using Github Pages using the `docs` directory.
